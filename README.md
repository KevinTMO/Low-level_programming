# **Low-Level Programming**
## C-based tasks for developing problem-solving skills

The purpose of this project is to develop programming logic by solving problems and creating programs based on the C language. All the directories contain programs that focus on different concepts of C and present various types of problems to be solved using the concepts learned throughout the project.

## General concepts learned about C Language:
- The creator of C Language - Dennis Ritchie
- What's a compiler?
- What happened when you compile a c file using gcc?
- What's an entry point?
- How does a main function influence the return value of a program?
- What are ASCii values?
